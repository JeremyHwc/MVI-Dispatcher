# Foreword

With the popularity of LiveData and ViewModel, developers also try to eliminate mutable boilerplate code by “local MVI pattern”.

According to the actual situation, most of the company’s “ancient giant projects” still need to upgrade and maintain Java, and Java is a frequent source of consistency problems, and “architectural components” are urgently needed to help eliminate hidden dangers.

Unfortunately, the current Android MVI articles or code cases are all written based on Kotlin language features, which are not friendly to Java, which makes Java developers interested in MVI mode in a dilemma.

The good news is that this issue comes with a well-polished MVI practice case.

# Project Description

I have been focusing on the “business architecture” model for a long time, and the open source components such as [UnPeekLiveData](https://github.com/KunMinX/UnPeek-LiveData) have been experienced in production environments such as QQ Music with over 100 million monthly lives.

In this case, I will show you how MVI-Dispatcher can simplify the otherwise “complicated and error-prone” message distribution process with just a few lines of code.

&nbsp;

```Groovy
implementation 'com.kunminx.arch:mvi-dispatch:7.5.0'

//Optional branch, easy and safe to read and write config
implementation 'com.kunminx.arch:keyvalue-dispatch:7.5.0'
```

&nbsp;

MVI-Dispatcher is applicable to Java, through which,

> 1.Can completely eliminate mutable boilerplate code, no need to write one line
>
> 2.Multiple events can be sent continuously to solve MVI scene LiveData event coverage
>
> 3.High performance fixed length queue, use as you go, run out of it, and never lose events
>
> 4.It can prevent team newbies from indiscriminately using mutableLiveData.setValue( ) in Activity/Fragment
>
> 5.Developers only need to pay attention to input and output, inject events from the unique entry input (), and observe at the unique exit output ()
>
> 6.If the new team members are not familiar with LiveData, UnPeekLiveData, mutable and MVI, they can also automatically realize the development of “one-way data flow” based on the simple and easy-to-understand I/O design of MVI-Dispatcher “single entry + single exit”
>
> 7.It can be seamlessly integrated into jetpack MVVM and other mode projects
